# Change Frequency Analysis

This page provides a detailed overview of the most frequently modified functions in the codebase. By highlighting change frequency, this analysis helps developers identify areas of the code that may require refactoring, additional testing, or closer review to improve maintainability.

**Key Insights**

- Functions with high modification frequency may indicate potential hotspots for instability or evolving requirements.
- Understanding change patterns can guide resource allocation for improving code quality and reducing technical debt.

Below is an example Change Frequency Analysis generated from the codexmaker repo. We've removed most of the content because it's boring but this is a small preview!
