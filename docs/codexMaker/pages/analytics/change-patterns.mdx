# Change Patterns

This page provides insights into how functions in the codebase change together. Understanding these co-change patterns is critical for improving dependency management, reducing regression risks, and prioritizing integration testing.

**Key Insights**

- Functions frequently modified together suggest potential coupling or shared dependencies.
- Co-change patterns can inform architectural improvements, such as reducing tight coupling or isolating shared logic.

Below is a small preview of a Change Patterns analysis from the codexmaker repository.
